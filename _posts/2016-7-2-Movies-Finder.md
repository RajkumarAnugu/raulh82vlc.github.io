title: Movies Finder clean architecture
---

Hello everyone,

I recently started an open-source project based on *Clean architecture* for **Android**. I would like to share it with you, and looking forward to see contributors.

My motto with this blog is to start collaborating at my spare time with the community and trying to help at the same time than learning myself about different topics.

As an overview, I would like to show you the project:
- [Movies Finder](https://github.com/raulh82vlc/Movies-Finder) on GitHub.

I am explaining further details at the _README.md_ file about the project itself.

But at this post, I would introduce you a little bit about my background regarding *clean architecture*.

Firstly, I would mention that I am trying to practice clean architecture from March 2015, when I discovered this approach and colleague and I at work, decide that it was really helpful for maintainable projects.
_Why?_
Because, despite *clean architecture* is not an easy subject a first time you try it, at the end it solves in a very structured way, certain complex problems as well as supports a team to make structured code with a solid and clean architecture which really worths it. Moreover, as an added value, this would make tests easier, which in the end is what everyones want. To be able to test easily and sleep well at night.

Note: I have to confess that at this iteration about this small project, there are not tests, but I am expecting to add them little by little.

I hope this contribution to the community would like you, and enjoy it as much as I did when I created it.
Waiting for your comments and suggestions though!
