title: Look For Events Location AR
---

When studying my *MSc thesis project* at *Cranfield University*,
I was really keen in *Augmented Reality (AR)*.
This is why I proposed this subject in addition to make it on the *Android platform*,
because I really loved the way Android was changing the *mobile* and *smartphones* scenario.

My first training course of *Android development* was at *2011* on my home university in *Spain*,
at *Polytechnic University of Valencia*. Thus, it really enhanced my interest for the platform.

This made me sure, that *Android* would be the right decision for the project and the foreseeable future.

At my original post at *2012* on my previous blog
- [Insights and projects](http://insightsandprojects.tumblr.com/) on Tumblr,
I mentioned the following information:

As it is shown different events of interest are shown by the Augmented Reality / Geo-location system.

## Description:
- 3 ongoing events
- 1 event that will start in 1 hour at least
- and 1 event that will start in more than an hour
- Basically are color dependent, where each color indicates the proximity in time to the current time wherever you are.

## Rules:
- Blue for events than are far away in time.
- Green for events about one hour
- Yellow for events that have more than 30 minutes
- Red for events really close in time
- White for ongoing events.
